I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Information Management and Information System** at the [School of Traffic and Transportation](https://jtys.lzjtu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou Jiaotong University](https://www.lzjtu.edu.cn/). 

Driven by a strong passion for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, my current research and development focus on:
- **LLM Application & Agents**: Building intelligent systems for complex task planning and execution.
- **Model Optimization**: Expertise in **Fine-tuning (SFT/LoRA)** and **Quantization (AWQ/GPTQ)** to enhance model efficiency and deployment.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Optimizing GPU kernels (Triton/CUDA) for deep learning operators.

### 🌟 Featured Projects
* **[FlagGems](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems)**: Contributed high-performance Triton kernels for operators like `logaddexp`, ensuring numerical stability and performance parity with native PyTorch.
* **LLM Fine-tuning & Quantization**: (建议此处补充一个你做过的微调或量化项目名)
